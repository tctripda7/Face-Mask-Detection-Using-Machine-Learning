# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Face Mask Detection is performed on realtime camera feed detecting whether people are wearing masks or not which is essential in current situation of pandemic caused by coronavirus.
Machine learning concepts are used in implementing this project such as concept of deep learning which involves CNN. 
Data training is done on the datasets which consists of further two categories of datasets i.e., with mask and without mask.
Then that training module is implemented with live video camera feed for detection of face masks in real time.
